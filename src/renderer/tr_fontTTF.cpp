	TrueType-backed replacement for the retail bitmap fonts.

	The retail fonts are fixed 12/24/48 point atlases.  On anything above the
	640x480 virtual canvas the GUI scales those atlases up, so text softens as
	the display resolution rises.  This path rasterises the shipped .ttf faces
	at the resolution the display actually needs and packs the result into a
	glyph atlas, which keeps text crisp at 1080p and 4K alike.

	It fills the same fontInfo_t the bitmap loader produces - identical metric
	units, identical UV conventions - so nothing downstream has to know which
	path produced the font.

R_TTFCollectExtendedCodePoints

Which code points above U+00FF the atlases have to carry, as a sorted list.

Three sources, unioned. The Unicode blocks the active language declares, so
text that never passed through a string table - a player name, a server name, a
line typed at the console - draws in the same alphabet as the menus around it.
The universal punctuation and symbol blocks above. And a sweep of the loaded
string tables, which catches whatever a language needs that nobody declared;
that sweep is what makes adding a language a matter of authoring its tables
rather than of editing this file.

Bounded by construction: the declared blocks are a few hundred code points, the
sweep can only surface characters that are actually in the shipped text, and
the face filters both down to what it has art for.

R_TTFRestoreAtlasMaterials

idDeclManagerLocal::BeginLevelLoad purges every declaration that is not marked
as parsed outside a level load, and idDeclManagerLocal::FindType clears that
mark on anything it resolves while a level is loading.  A face first registered
during a load - or any face re-registered during one, which is what a lazy font
refresh after a vid_restart does - therefore ends up classified as level media.

For a shipped material that is harmless: the next reference reparses it from its
.mtr text.  These atlas materials have no file, and the implicit text the
manager generates for a nameless declaration maps an image called after the
material itself, which does not exist.  That resolves to the default image,
which is fully transparent outside developer builds, so a purged atlas material
draws every glyph as nothing at all - silently, with no warning and no way back
inside the session.

The stage is now carried in the declaration's own text, so a purge is
recoverable; this reasserts it immediately after the purge, before the loading
screen or anything else draws with a font.
